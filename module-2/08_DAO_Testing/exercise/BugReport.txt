Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    get timesheets by employee id

Expected output:
    List of 2 items
    (timesheets 1, 2; given employee 1)

Actual output:
    List of 1 item

How did you fix this bug?
    (line 40) changed 'if' to 'while'
    in front of '(results.next()) { //... }'
    so that it iterated through all the results
    rather than just adding the first result


Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    get timesheets by project id

Expected output:
    List of 3 items
    (timesheets 1, 2, 3; given project 1)

Actual output:
    List of 2 items

How did you fix this bug?
    (line 51) changed 'WHERE employee_id = ?' to 'WHERE project_id = ?'
    so that it is searching based on project id
    not employee id

Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    updated timesheet has expected values when retrieved

Expected output:
    an updated timesheet reflecting newly updated values

Actual output:
    a partially updated timesheet missing the updated 'billable' boolean value

How did you fix this bug?
    (line 74) added 'billable = ?' to the sql statement
        "SET employee_id = ?, project_id = ?, date_worked = ?, hours_worked = ?, billable = ?, description = ? "
    & (line 77) added 'updatedTimesheet.isBillable()'
        /*...*/ updatedTimesheet.getHoursWorked(), updatedTimesheet.isBillable(), updatedTimesheet.getDescription() /*...*/
    so that updating 'billable' will correctly update the timesheet

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    get billable hours returns correct total

Expected output:
    0 (for employee 2, project 2)

Actual output:
    2

How did you fix this bug?
    (line 92) added 'AND billable IS TRUE' to sql statement
        "WHERE employee_id = ? AND project_id = ? AND billable IS TRUE"
     so that it does not add non-billable hours to the returned sum
